       " 'Abstract': ['We explore the potential drivers for and barriers to interdisciplinary education in design from the student learning perspective. To achieve this, a series of in-depth student interview studies were conducted at two interdisciplinary design schools in the Republic of Korea and the UK. Results indicated both awareness and synthesis of interdisciplinary perspectives across the two schools. However, these abilities appeared more heavily dependent upon individual student attitudes and interests, compared to the programmes of study themselves. Instructor bias and potential integration issues at school and institutional levels were further cited as challenges to interdisciplinarity. However, results also indicated application as a key driver for the acquisition and synthesis of disciplinary perspectives. Students, within the applied discipline of design, responded well to interdisciplinarity when accompanied by opportunities to integrate disciplinary knowledge through application within their own project works. Implications for interdisciplinary approaches to design education are finally discussed together with suggested avenues for future investigation. © 2018 Springer Nature B.V.',\n",
       "  \"We introduce Traffico, a tangible timetable representing dematerialized schedule and transportation information. It delivers a user's schedules in chronological order along with transportation information between schedules. Placed on the user's desk, Traffico suggests required transportation times using four options - walking, bicycling, bussing, and driving a car - and through an e-ink display. To investigate the advantages that Traffico provides to users, we conducted an in-field study of 10 participants over five days. The results revealed that Traffico supports the planning of moving times in a day through displaying transportation options on each schedule. We also found that Traffico provides better schedule reminders with event notifications in a sequential order, along with rotating interaction for checking events. Through this type of tangible interaction, Traffico provides possibilities to reflect dematerialized digital information into a physical form and to adopt a new way of scheduling and handling time. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\",\n",
       "  'Increasingly, the unboxing experience is regarded as a critical moment in product appraisal. As such, designers and companies should pay more attention to product packaging due to this increased interest in the momentary unboxing experience. In this study, we examine aesthetic interaction’s influence upon emotional and semantic appraisals of the packaged product at the moment of unboxing. Three factors of aesthetic interaction were adopted and used in the design of packaging stimuli: freedom of interaction, interaction pattern, and richness of motor actions. The findings indicated that differences in aesthetic interaction between the three packaging designs evoked particular positive emotions and delivered different semantic appraisals of the packaged products. Thus, the study provides design researchers and practitioners with an increased understanding of how aesthetic interaction can be leveraged in packaging design to enhance the unboxing experience. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group',\n",

       "  'Interdisciplinarity is becoming a critical issue of concern for design schools across East Asia in their attempts to provide industry graduates with the skills and competences to make creative contributions in a global economy. As a result, East Asian higher education institutions are aggressively endeavouring to provide interdisciplinary undergraduate curriculum that combine traditional designerly skills with engineering knowledge and methods. The current study takes an interdisciplinary undergraduate course as case-study to examine how the pedagogic strategy of team teaching influences student learning experience. Two surveys of student learning were conducted for this research purpose. The first provided an indication of the holistic student learning experience, while the second explored the conditions of team and non-team teaching as influence upon learning experiences specifically. Results showed how students taught by a single instructor provided a more positive overall opinion of course quality and experienced significantly more encouragement to participate compared to team taught respondents. However, findings also indicated how team teaching significantly increased the students’ experience of a balanced contribution from different disciplinary perspectives and how the team teaching approach was significantly more effective in providing students with greater opportunities to understand the relevance of the different disciplines to the course subject. We conclude with a discussion of results in terms of the effective use of team teaching at undergraduate level as strategy for interdisciplinary learning experiences. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.',\n",
       "  'It is challenging to design for mutually beneficial relationships in a multi-actor service system when these actors have diverse and conflicting interests, and lack usable methods and tools that support the design process. This study introduces a novel method for co-designing value exchange (COVALENT). COVALENT integrates the value analysis model, co-design strategy and service design tools, to support the conceptualisation of reciprocal value exchanges based on the analysis of and matching between, stakeholders’ needs and resources. Its perceived effectiveness was validated through application to the development of community business models in Ulsan, South Korea. This study contributes to the knowledge of co-design by providing a method for co-designing services that aim to achieve reciprocal value exchanges in the context of community-centred design and by discussing the effectiveness of that method as perceived by users. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group',\n",
       "  'The influence of a design education upon reasoning in response to ill-defined design problems was examined through a comparative protocol study of design and non-design students. A statistical analysis compared distributions of and transitions between the activities naming, framing, moving, and reflecting. Design student protocols were characterized by significantly increased activity associated with reasoning between problem definition and solution ideation. In contrast, participants lacking any formal design education or experience indicated significantly increased reasoning towards problem definition, with little evidence of ideation. A subsequent qualitative comparison identifies sketching as a potential driver for both increased solution-focused activity and greater iteration between problem definition and solution ideation. Implications for design ability, sketching and appositional bridge-building between problem definition and solution ideation are discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
       "  'Background Mode-of-use innovation, or the innovative means by which products may be used, is considered as one lever for design-driven innovation. The current study explored how the mode-of-use concept may apply to state-of-the-art product interactions and enhance user experience, in turn providing opportunities for design-driven innovation within the interactive product space. Methods As framework to explore the application of mode-of-use innovation in interactive experiences, we adopted taxonomy of interaction styles. Generic interaction styles in product experience were classified through two criteria; whether interaction supports explanatory or exploratory modes, and whether the product interface is discrete or composite. Adopting a research-through-design approach, two interactive mood lamps were designed, expressed as high-fidelity prototypes and used as stimuli to evaluate product experience according to different interaction styles. Results Results indicated that the touch-free magic interaction style, an interaction providing explorative and composite modes of interaction, was initially considered more innovative in terms of mode-of-use, possibly triggered by the novelty of the interaction. However participants also expressed negative experiences in touch-free magic interactions compared to explanatory modes-of-use interactions due to poor haptic feedback and inability to intuitively understand the mode-of-use. Conclusions Implications for understanding how mode-of-use may be applied to interactive product design are finally discussed. Although more work is required to understand how best more novel explorative interactions may stimulate initial feelings of innovativeness, caution is required in providing mode-of-use innovations that allow opportunities for clear understanding of interaction as related to function feedback, mapping well onto user expectations.',\n",

       "  'The study compared the use of digital and conventional sketching as influence upon conceptual design work. The results show a significantly increased focus of attention upon the sketching tool in the digital condition compared to conventional sketching with pen and paper. Both a statistical analysis and fine-grained qualitative comparison illustrate how increased frequencies of sketching tool focused activities resulted in both significantly more time spent in problem orientated work and the fragmentation of attempts to transition from problem definition to generative solution ideation. In contrast, reduced tool-focused activity in the conventional sketching condition appeared to provide opportunities for significantly increased solution ideation through design-driven moves to explore, reflect upon and develop solution propositions. The implications of a tool orientated focus of attention are discussed in terms of its impact upon reflective solution ideation during conceptual design.

       "  \"From the ubiquitous hand-sketch to high fidelity prototypes, designers employ design representation as a means to externalise, reflect upon, communicate and develop design intentions. As a result of their importance, efforts have been made to identify and classify the different attributes of various representations used during design practice. An existing quantitative approach to the identification and classification of complexity within design representation is used as a coding frame in a content analysis of design representations identified within 50 design case-studies. Results indicate the complexity scale's limitations as a means of analysis due to the subjectivity and interpretation required in its application. Conceptual and developmental design representation was particularly resistant to the objective measurement of complexity, indicating the role subjectivity and interpretation play in design representation, particularly during conceptual design. Results provide further evidence to suggest the limitations of research methods based upon the paradigm of design as a rational problem solving process, with its emphasis on objective observation. Instead we provide evidence to support a constructed account of design practice as a reflective conversation with the situation, influenced by and dependent upon representation, subjective judgment and interpretation.\",\n",
       "  'Design awards have become a valuable means for frms to distinguish the quality of their design work from that of their competitors, thus acting as symbols of recognition. Although their benefts appear to be clear, this empirical study contributes to the knowledge and understanding of the factors that inform how the notion of a design award is perceived by those who may take part in awards competitions. A qualitative content analysis of survey responses highlights how attitudes towards design awards are informed by perceptions of and associations between such factors as the perceived quality of awarding criteria, validity of judgments during design evaluation, perceptions of fees, and the quality of awarded designs. These factors and their associations contribute to a greater understanding of how contemporary attitudes towards awards competitions are formed. Findings are positioned to both stimulate debate and provide a point of departure for studies of attitudes towards and perceptions of various design awards competitions. Through a greater understanding of how awards competitions are perceived, opportunities exist to continue to increase their reputation for the beneft of both those that stage awards competitions and those who may participate in them. © 2014 Self.',\n",

These design embodiments support both the exploration of the design problem and the emergence and communication of solution ideas. From the ever present design sketch through to 3D computer aided design and rapid prototyping technologies, an increasing variety of digital, analogue and hybrid design tools are employed in the embodiment of design proposals during practice. A literature review identified existing studies of the implicit characteristics of tool use during design activity. These characteristics where employed in the design of a survey study. The survey took samples from two distinct groups, industrial design practitioners and students. A total of 244 designers; 138 practitioners and 106 students, were surveyed. Findings indicated a tendency for student design activity to be characterised by strong convergence and less exploration, leading to early fixation and attachment to concept. This was in contrast to practitioner responses suggesting a more open, divergent and iterative approach. A concern for conventional research dissemination, articulated through conference papers and academic journals, to engage a practice orientated audience lead to the development of a digital resource (IDsite) to disseminate the survey findings. Work on the digital resource is ongoing; however the paper describes an interim pilot of the resource with a small sample of design practitioners. Findings suggest that, although the resource requires further development in terms of the presentation of information, practitioners consider the approach to be of relevance to the profession.\"],\n",
